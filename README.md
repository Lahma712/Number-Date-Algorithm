# Number-Date-Algorithm

This program is written in Python 3.7. It consists of 2 algorithms. The first algorithm called 'NumberToDate'
allows the user to input a number between 1-365 and get the corresponding date of the year(DD/MM/2019). 
This algorithm does not include leap years (february has 28 days). To chose this algorithm, enter '1' after the program asks you "NumberToDate or DateToNumber?(1/2)"


<b>Example</b>

<em>Please enter a day of the year(number between 1-365): 60 </em>

<b>OUTPUT</b>

<em>Date : 1.3.2019 </em>

The second algorithm is called "DateToNumber" and allows the user to
give a date as input and get the corresponding day number of the year.
To chose this algorithm, enter '2' after the program asks you "NumberToDate or DateToNumber?(1/2)"


<b>Example</b>

<em> Day: 1 </em>

<em> Month: 3 </em>

<b>OUTPUT</b>

<em> Date: 1.3.2019 </em>

<em> Number of day: 60 </em>
